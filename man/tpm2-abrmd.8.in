.SH NAME
tpm2-abrmd \- TPM2 access broker and resource management daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tpm2-abrmd
.RB [\-m][\-e][\-i][\-o][\-l\ logger-name][\-r][\-s][\-g\ /dev/urandom][\-t\ conf]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tpm2-abrmd
is a daemon that implements the TPM access broker and resource manager as
described by the Trusted Computing Group (TGC) in the
.B \*(lqTSS System Level API and TPM Command Transmission Interface
.B Specification\*(rq.
This daemon uses the DBus system bus and some pipes to communicate with
clients.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-t,\ \-\-tcti\fR
Provide the daemon with a string that describes the TCTI and how to configure
it for communication with the next component down the TSS2 stack. This string
is formatted as "tcti-name:tcti-conf" where:
.RS
.IP 'tcti-name'
The name of the TCTI library shared object file. Libraries are found using
the same algorithm as dlopen (3). If the TCTI library file name follows the
naming convention: \fBlibtss2-tcti-<name>.so.0\fR where <name> is the name for
the TCTI, the value of \fB<name>\fR may be supplied in place of the full
library file name. See 'EXAMPLES' below.
.IP 'tcti-conf'
The configuration string passed to the TCTI library upon initialization.
.PP
If this option is omitted (or a NULL string provided) then a default TCTI is
used in it's default configuration. If the string does not contain a colon
then it will be interpreted as only the 'tcti-name'. To provide only the
configuration string (using the default TCTI) then the first character in the
string passed to this option must be a colon followed by the configuration
string. See examples below.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-o,\ \-\-allow-root\fR
Allow daemon to run as root. If this option is not provided the daemon will
refused to run as the root user. Use of this option is \fBnot\fR recommended.
.TP
\fB\-m,\ \-\-max-connections\fR
Set an upper bound on the number of concurrent client connections allowed.
Once this number of client connections is reached new connections will be
rejected with an error.
.TP
\fB\-f,\ \-\-flush-all\fR
Flush all objects and sessions when daemon is started.
.TP
\fB\-l,\ \-\-logger\fR
Direct logging output to named logging target. Supported targets are
\fBstdout\fR and \fBsyslog\fR. If the logger option is not specified the
default is \fBstdout\fR.
.TP
\fB\-e,\ \-\-max-sessions\fR
Set and upper bound on the number of sessions that each client connection
is allowed to create (loaded or active) at any one time.
.TP
\fB\-r,\ \-\-max-transients\fR
Set an upper bound on the number of transient objects that each client
connection allowed to load. Once this number of objects is reached attempts
to load new transient objects will produce an error.
.TP
\fB\-n,\ \-\-dbus-name\fR
Claim the given name on dbus. This option overrides the default of
com.intel.tss2.Tabrmd.
.TP
\fB\-g,\ \-\-prng-seed-file\fR
Read seed for pseudo-random number generator from the provided file.
.TP
\fB\-s,\ \-\-session\fR
Connect daemon to the session dbus. This option overrides the default
behavior.
.TP
\fB\-v,\ \-\-version\fR
Display version string.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP 3
Execute daemon with default TCTI and options:
.B tpm2-abrmd
.TP
Execute daemon with default TCTI and provided config string:
.B tpm2-abrmd --tcti=":/dev/tpm0"
.TP
This is equivalent to:
.B tpm2-abrmd --tcti="device:/dev/tpm0"
.br
.B tpm2-abrmd --tcti="libtss2-tcti-device.so.0:/dev/tpm0"
.TP
Have daemon use Microsoft/IBM TPM2 Simulator tcti library
'libtss2-tcti-mssim.so.0'.
This connects to a TPM2 simulator via a TCP mssim.
.br
.B tpm2-abrmd --tcti="mssim"
.br
.B tpm2-abrmd --tcti="libtss2-tcti-mssim.so.0"
.TP
Have daemon use tcti library 'libtss2-tcti-mssim.so.0' and config string
'host=127.0.0.1,port=5555':
.B tpm2-abrmd --tcti=mssim:host=127.0.0.1,port=5555"
.br
.B tpm2-abrmd --tcti="libtss2-tcti-mssim.so.0:host=127.0.0.1,port=5555"
